Original prompt: Gut wie gesagt ich will ds du in dieser Session alles auf deine Branch pushst. Du implementierst nun: GamePlan-Kurve-der-Veränderung.txt

- Created missing game prototype scaffold for Change Management topic "Kurve der Veraenderung".
- Target files: game_kurve_der_veraenderung.html/.js/.json in the same folder as the GamePlan.
- TODO: run Playwright scenario and inspect screenshot + render_game_to_text output.
- Implemented HTML/JS/JSON for game_kurve_der_veraenderung with 7-phase matching interaction.
- Added click + drag assignment, scoring, and phase explanations.
- Added render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
- Updated game_kurve_der_veraenderung visual theme to match Teil01 dark/cyan UI language.
- Reworked portrait layout: statements panel moves first, phase curve remains horizontal-scrollable, and pool gets bounded height for usability.
- Fixed visibility issue: statement cards now enforce dark text on light background.
- Portrait mode validated (390x844): game sections stack in usable order and remain interactive.
- Started implementation for GamePlan-Make-or-Buy-Calculator: added new game HTML/JS/JSON in Fremdvergabe folder.
- Implemented 5-case cost comparison flow with slider, bars, scoring, and break-even helper.
- Original prompt (current turn): implementiere GamePlan-Failover-Simulator.txt dann commite
- Implemented new game in Verlaesslichkeit-Robustheit bewerten: game_failover_simulator.html/.js/.json and failover_simulator.css.
- Added 10 disaster scenarios, Level 1-3 special flow (DB-Ausfall, Split-Brain, Cascading Failure), HUD (System-Health, Uptime/SLA, RTO), scoring incl. +5000 for Zero Data Loss and downtime penalty.
- Added visual diagnostics: glitch effect, heat-based node coloring, mission-control layout, action console, diagnostic feed, render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
- Playwright smoke test executed against game_failover_simulator.html (local http.server + web_game_playwright_client).
- Verified render_game_to_text transitions from idle to active mission state (round 1 loaded, failed DB node, RTO running).
- Note: screenshot artifact captures only the health graph canvas in this runner; state JSON was used as primary validation of runtime behavior.
- Original prompt (current turn): ok, nun implementiere und commite GamePlan-Doku-Zielgruppen-Match.txt
- Implemented new Dokumentation game: game_doku_zielgruppen_match.html/.js/.json and doku_zielgruppen_match.css.
- Added 25 snippets across 3 levels (Klare Sprache, Target-Bleeding, Support-Crisis), HUD for User-Confusion, Knowledge-Points, Target-Doc, and timed readability bar.
- Added scoring rules incl. Silent Knowledge bonus (+150) and technical-noise penalty when admin content is routed to user docs.
- Added mobile swipe-to-bin gestures (left=admin, right=user), diagnostic feed, confusion-wave visual, render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
- Playwright smoke test executed for game_doku_zielgruppen_match (local http.server + web_game_playwright_client).
- Verified active runtime state after start: started=true, level 1 loaded, timer running, snippet payload exported via render_game_to_text.
- Visual check completed on generated screenshot (desktop layout, bins, HUD, confusion meter and feed visible).
- Added high-confusion warning state (>=70%): confusion meter and feedback area now switch to stronger warning styling.
- Original prompt (current turn): GamePlan-Make-or-Buy-Waage.txt
- Implemented new game in Teil02/Fremdvergabe: game_make_or_buy_waage.html/.js/.json and make_or_buy_waage.css.
- Added 20 decision factors across 3 levels (incl. Budget-Squeeze and Strategic Shift event), weighted make/buy scale, KPI HUD (Decision-Stability, Remaining Budget, Time-to-Market), and scoring rules with core-competence bonus + vendor-lock-in penalty without exit strategy.
- Added draggable factor card, clickable pans, result ticker, render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
- Playwright smoke test executed; UI and active state (started=true, factor loaded) validated via screenshot and state JSON.
- Applied targeted improvements on existing Make-or-Buy-Waage implementation: keyboard controls (A/Left=Make, D/Right=Buy, Space/Enter=Next) and explicit level labels (Klar/Budget/Shift).
- Added explicit pointer-events:auto on scale pans and factor card for better mobile precision.
- Simplified Make-or-Buy-Waage UI drastically: removed overloaded panels/ticker, kept only core KPIs, scale, factor card, and minimal actions.
- Removed Next button flow; after each decision feedback is shown for 5 seconds, then the next factor is loaded automatically.
- Added explicit on-screen usage explanation and preserved drag + click + keyboard controls.
- Original prompt (current turn): Stil aus Machbarkeitsanalyse/Projektmanagement uebernehmen und GamePlan-Moderations-Master umsetzen.
- Implemented Workshop game in intentionally simple/intuitive style: game_moderations_master.html/.js/.json and moderations_master.css.

- Added scoring with Flow-State bonus and Method-Boredom penalty, plus render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
- Smoke tested via Playwright: active round + visual layout validated.
- Original prompt (current turn): weiter mit GamePlan-Nutzwert-Navigator.txt
- Implemented Nutzwert Navigator in simple/intuitive style: game_nutzwert_navigator.html/.js/.json and nutzwert_navigator.css.
- Added 10 weighted decision cases across 3 levels (Simple Choice, Stakeholder Clash, Stress Test), live ranking bars, objectivity rating, and decision confidence via ±5% sensitivity runs.
- Added robust-decision bonus and biased-scoring penalty, with auto-next flow after evaluation and render_game_to_text/advanceTime hooks.
- Smoke tested via Playwright: first case loaded, live scoring/ranking visible, state output valid.
