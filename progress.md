Original prompt: Gut wie gesagt ich will ds du in dieser Session alles auf deine Branch pushst. Du implementierst nun: GamePlan-Kurve-der-Veränderung.txt

- Created missing game prototype scaffold for Change Management topic "Kurve der Veraenderung".
- Target files: game_kurve_der_veraenderung.html/.js/.json in the same folder as the GamePlan.
- TODO: run Playwright scenario and inspect screenshot + render_game_to_text output.
- Implemented HTML/JS/JSON for game_kurve_der_veraenderung with 7-phase matching interaction.
- Added click + drag assignment, scoring, and phase explanations.
- Added render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
- Updated game_kurve_der_veraenderung visual theme to match Teil01 dark/cyan UI language.
- Reworked portrait layout: statements panel moves first, phase curve remains horizontal-scrollable, and pool gets bounded height for usability.
- Fixed visibility issue: statement cards now enforce dark text on light background.
- Portrait mode validated (390x844): game sections stack in usable order and remain interactive.
- Started implementation for GamePlan-Make-or-Buy-Calculator: added new game HTML/JS/JSON in Fremdvergabe folder.
- Implemented 5-case cost comparison flow with slider, bars, scoring, and break-even helper.
- Original prompt (current turn): implementiere GamePlan-Failover-Simulator.txt dann commite
- Implemented new game in Verlaesslichkeit-Robustheit bewerten: game_failover_simulator.html/.js/.json and failover_simulator.css.
- Added 10 disaster scenarios, Level 1-3 special flow (DB-Ausfall, Split-Brain, Cascading Failure), HUD (System-Health, Uptime/SLA, RTO), scoring incl. +5000 for Zero Data Loss and downtime penalty.
- Added visual diagnostics: glitch effect, heat-based node coloring, mission-control layout, action console, diagnostic feed, render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
- Playwright smoke test executed against game_failover_simulator.html (local http.server + web_game_playwright_client).
- Verified render_game_to_text transitions from idle to active mission state (round 1 loaded, failed DB node, RTO running).
- Note: screenshot artifact captures only the health graph canvas in this runner; state JSON was used as primary validation of runtime behavior.
- Original prompt (current turn): ok, nun implementiere und commite GamePlan-Doku-Zielgruppen-Match.txt
- Implemented new Dokumentation game: game_doku_zielgruppen_match.html/.js/.json and doku_zielgruppen_match.css.

- Added scoring rules incl. Silent Knowledge bonus (+150) and technical-noise penalty when admin content is routed to user docs.
- Added mobile swipe-to-bin gestures (left=admin, right=user), diagnostic feed, confusion-wave visual, render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
