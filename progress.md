Original prompt: Gut wie gesagt ich will ds du in dieser Session alles auf deine Branch pushst. Du implementierst nun: GamePlan-Kurve-der-Veränderung.txt

- Created missing game prototype scaffold for Change Management topic "Kurve der Veraenderung".
- Target files: game_kurve_der_veraenderung.html/.js/.json in the same folder as the GamePlan.
- TODO: run Playwright scenario and inspect screenshot + render_game_to_text output.
- Implemented HTML/JS/JSON for game_kurve_der_veraenderung with 7-phase matching interaction.
- Added click + drag assignment, scoring, and phase explanations.
- Added render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks.
- Updated game_kurve_der_veraenderung visual theme to match Teil01 dark/cyan UI language.
- Reworked portrait layout: statements panel moves first, phase curve remains horizontal-scrollable, and pool gets bounded height for usability.
- Fixed visibility issue: statement cards now enforce dark text on light background.
- Portrait mode validated (390x844): game sections stack in usable order and remain interactive.
- Started implementation for GamePlan-Make-or-Buy-Calculator: added new game HTML/JS/JSON in Fremdvergabe folder.
- Implemented 5-case cost comparison flow with slider, bars, scoring, and break-even helper.
